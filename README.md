# Flashcards Program 

**Functional Programming & Domain Specific Languages (EECS 776) Final Project**
<br>
A program to review a deck of flashcards read in from file, implemented in Haskell.

## How to use:

1. **Compile:** Go to the **flash-cards** directory and type **ghc --make flash_cards.hs**<br>
2. **Run:** Type **./flash_cards quiz.txt**, where quiz.txt can be replaced with any other text file holding review material. 
They must be formatted with each card in a new line, with the question and answer separated by a colon like "question goes here : and answer goes here"<br>
3. **Follow the instructions on the screen!**
